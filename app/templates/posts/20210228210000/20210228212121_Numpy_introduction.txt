### Numpy - Introduction<br/><br/>

Numpy stands for Numerical Python. The main areas where the library can be helpful are:<br/>
- improve speed-algorithms are written in C so the pace of data processing is faster<br/>
- simplify loops-the library can reduce the number of iterations. It can also impact on clean code<br/>
- usable mathematical algorithms - Numpy enables using many mathematical concepts like:  trigonometric,
statistics, linear algebra.<br/>

First step is to import library:<br />
>`import numpy as np`
